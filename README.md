# TDI-Challenge-Project
This project is to do an exploratory data analysis on how travellers in February 2015 expressed their feelings on Twitter. The basic purposes are to determine the reasons for people feeling positive or negative about an airline and what airlines are more frequently received negative sentiments. 
This can be useful for further exploration on the prediction of traveller's sentiments on airlines. A classification model can be proposed to predict the attitudes of travellers.
